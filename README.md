# G-Drive-Automation

## Overview
This application streamlines my photo management process by automatically uploading images from a local folder to Google Drive. Image loading from my DSLR camera is now automated through an external Canon software.

## Background
I like to take photos. I developed this application to automate the tedious steps of uploading them. Previously, after manually importing photos from my camera, I manually transferred these images to Google Drive. **G-Drive-Automation** now handles this process.

## Technology
Built with Python and the Google Drive API.
